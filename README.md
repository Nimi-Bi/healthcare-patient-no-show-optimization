**Healthcare Patient No-Show Optimization**

**Project Overview**

Patient no-shows are a major challenge for healthcare organizations, leading to lost revenue, underutilized provider capacity, and reduced operational efficiency.

This project simulates a healthcare business intelligence solution designed to analyze patient no-show behavior and identify opportunities to improve appointment attendance.

The project was built using Excel, MySQL, and Power BI.

**Business Problem**

Healthcare providers frequently experience missed appointments that result in:

Lost revenue

Inefficient resource utilization

Increased patient waiting times

Reduced access to care

**The objective of this project** is to identify the factors associated with patient no-shows and provide actionable recommendations.

**Tools Used**

Microsoft Excel

MySQL

Power BI

GitHub

Dataset

**The project includes four relational tables:**

**Patient**

Patient_ID
Patient_Name
Gender
Age
City_Type
Insurance_Status

**Doctor**

Doctor_ID
First_Name
Last_Name
Specialty
Department
Clinic_Branch

**Appointment**

Appointment_ID
Patient_ID
Doctor_ID
Appointment_Date
Waiting_Days
SMS_Reminder
No_Show

**Billing**

Billing_ID
Appointment_ID
Appointment_Cost
Estimated_Loss

**SQL Analysis**

**Five business questions were investigated:**

What is the overall patient no-show rate?

Which department experiences the highest revenue loss?

Do SMS reminders reduce patient no-shows?

How does waiting time affect patient attendance?

Which days of the week experience the highest no-show rates?

**Key Findings**

Overall No-Show Rate

Total Appointments: 9,725

Total No-Shows: 1,888

No-Show Rate: 19.41%

**Financial Impact**

Total Revenue Loss: $325,089

Highest Impact Department: Cardiology ($116,358)

**SMS Reminder Effectiveness**

Reminder Sent: 14.97% No-Show Rate

No Reminder: 30.11% No-Show Rate

**Waiting Time Impact**

0–7 Days: 12.90%

31+ Days: 21.99%

Longer waiting periods were associated with higher no-show rates.

**Recommendations**

Expand SMS reminder programs.

Reduce appointment waiting times where possible.

Prioritize no-show reduction initiatives in Cardiology.

Monitor patients with appointments scheduled more than 30 days in advance.

**Dashboard**

Power BI dashboard screenshots will be added after dashboard development is completed.
